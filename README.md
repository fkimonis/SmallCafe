# SmallCafe

Developement was done in Visual Studio 2012
Compiling should pull all the relevant packages with the help of nuget.
I am using xUnit instead of NUnit, for some reason I couldn't get the test runner to hit any of the tests. XUnit worked out of the box.
I've included comments as and when needed.

That's it - Any feedback would be very much appreciated!
